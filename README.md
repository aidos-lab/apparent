Analysing Physician Networks via Ollivier Ricci Curvature


## Installation

It is recommended to use the [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org) package
manager. With `poetry` installed, setting up the repository works like
this:

```
$ poetry install
```

Since `poetry` creates its own virtual environment, it is easiest to
interact with scripts by calling `poetry shell`.
